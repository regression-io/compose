**Breadcrumb check.** Before this batch of edits, did you write a one-line intent breadcrumb?

```bash
echo "$(date -Iseconds) | <WHY you are making these changes>" >> .compose/breadcrumbs.log
```

The breadcrumb captures intent, not files. Good: "Adding theme toggle to header". Bad: "Editing App.jsx".

If you already wrote one for this batch, carry on.
